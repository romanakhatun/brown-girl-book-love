This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) static sit generator starter. Markdown files are used to
store page data. All markdown are sanitized when transformed into html.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Static Build

```bash
npm run static-build
# or
yarn static-build
```

To run the static build locally:

npm run serve
# or
yarn serve
```
